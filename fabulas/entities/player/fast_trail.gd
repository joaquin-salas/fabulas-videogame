class_name FastTrail extends Line2D

## Self-contained speed trail. Watches its own parent Player and decides
## entirely on its own when to grow and when to fade — nothing outside this
## script needs to know it exists.

# ====================== CONSTANTS ======================
## Multiplier over the theoretical max Y velocity of a normal jump, so the
## trail only activates when something (like a LaunchPlatform boost) pushes
## velocity meaningfully above what regular movement can reach.
const TRAIL_ACTIVATION_MARGIN: float = 1.2

# ====================== EXPORTED VARIABLES ======================
@export var max_points: int = 20
## How many points per second are trimmed off while fading out. Higher = faster fade.
@export var fade_rate: float = 60.0

# ====================== REFERENCE VARIABLES ======================
@onready var player: Player = get_parent()

# ====================== LOCAL VARIABLES ======================
